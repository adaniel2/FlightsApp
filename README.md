## Introduction

It is often the case that when a prospective passenger looking to purchase flight tickets, they resort to online booking platforms such as Google Flights, Expedia, Kayak, Booking.com, and many more. It is then that they often find themselves asking how they can get to their destination in the fastest, cost-effective, most comfortable and reliable way possible. That is, each purchase should meet the individual’s or party’s travel needs and expectations accordingly. To this end, we intended to create a small application featuring a simple command line interface (CLI) designed to provide users with the ability to plan trips like that of Google Flights, but specifically for North American domestic & international flights. This would involve having the ability to lookup prices/routes based on desired travel class, number of passengers and other similar features. More interestingly, we also look to explore implementation of features not often readily available from the aforementioned platforms.

The data that will be used for such solution would be obtained by tailoring a combination of datasets from multiple sources to achieve the desired IO functionality. Such datasets include dozens of attributes like date, scheduled departure/arrival time, airline, ground/airtime, and many more, which could provide the basis for creating entities and relationships between such entities to be able to respond to user queries. The dataset will aim to be as recent as possible, however, we will also consider the possibility of associating less recent data with more up-to-date data (old routes with recent prices for example) if necessary.
